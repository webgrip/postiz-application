* **Status**: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

Applications require a production deployment platform that supports horizontal scaling, rolling deployments, health monitoring, and efficient resource utilization. Traditional deployment approaches using VMs or bare metal lack the operational sophistication needed for modern cloud-native applications.

The template must provide deployment patterns for:
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Zero-downtime deployments with rollback capabilities
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Resource isolation and multi-tenancy
- Observability and health monitoring
- Secret management and configuration injection

## Decision Drivers

| # | Driver (why this matters)                                    |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | Enable horizontal auto-scaling (handle traffic spikes)      |
| 2 | Support zero-downtime deployments with rollback capability  |
| 3 | Provide built-in service discovery and load balancing       |
| 4 | Enable efficient resource utilization across workloads      |
| 5 | Support multi-environment deployments (dev/staging/prod)    |
| 6 | Integrate with observability and monitoring solutions       |
| 7 | Provide declarative infrastructure-as-code approach         |
| 8 | Enable team autonomy with proper resource isolation         |

## Considered Options

1. **Traditional VMs** – Deployment on virtual machines with manual orchestration
2. **Docker Swarm** – Docker's native orchestration platform
3. **Kubernetes** – Industry-standard container orchestration platform
4. **Managed container services** – AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, Google Cloud Run
5. **Serverless platforms** – AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Option

**Kubernetes**

### Rationale

Kubernetes provides the most comprehensive and mature container orchestration platform with:

- **Industry standard**: Widespread adoption, extensive ecosystem, transferable skills
- **Vendor neutrality**: Works across cloud providers and on-premises environments
- **Declarative management**: YAML manifests enable infrastructure-as-code practices
- **Comprehensive feature set**: Auto-scaling, rolling updates, health checks, service mesh integration
- **Ecosystem integration**: Extensive tooling for monitoring, logging, security, and CI/CD

The template implements Kubernetes deployment patterns including:
- Pod disruption budgets for availability
- Resource requests/limits for efficient scheduling
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration
- Service mesh ready networking
- ConfigMap and Secret management integration

### Positive Consequences

* Horizontal auto-scaling handles traffic variations automatically
* Rolling deployments enable zero-downtime updates with automatic rollback
* Built-in service discovery eliminates manual load balancer configuration
* Resource quotas and namespaces provide proper multi-tenancy
* Extensive monitoring and observability integration options
* Skills and patterns are transferable across cloud providers
* Large ecosystem of operators and tools for specialized workloads
* GitOps deployment patterns using declarative manifests

### Negative Consequences / Trade‑offs

* Steep learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Kubernetes concepts
* Additional operational complexity compared to simpler deployment models
* Resource overhead for cluster management and control plane
* Potential over-engineering for simple, low-traffic applications
* Troubleshooting requires understanding of multiple Kubernetes layers
* Lock-in to container-based architecture patterns

### Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk**: Kubernetes cluster management complexity and security vulnerabilities
  * **Mitigation**: Use managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS), implement RBAC, regular security updates
* **Risk**: Application performance degradation due to networking overhead
  * **Mitigation**: Proper resource allocation, network policies, service mesh implementation
* **Risk**: Development team productivity decline during learning curve
  * **Mitigation**: Training programs, comprehensive documentation, gradual migration strategy

## Validation

* **Immediate proof** – Helm charts successfully deploy application with proper health checks, resource management, and auto-scaling configuration
* **Ongoing guardrails** – Kubernetes static analysis (kube-score, kube-linter, kubesec), resource monitoring, deployment success metrics

## Compliance, Security & Privacy Impact

Kubernetes deployments implement security best practices including:
- Non-root container execution with security contexts
- Resource limits preventing resource exhaustion attacks
- Network policies for micro-segmentation
- RBAC controls for API access
- Secret management with encryption at rest
- Pod security standards enforcement
- Regular security scanning of container images and manifests

## Notes

* **Related Decisions**: ADR-001 (Docker development environment), ADR-003 (Helm deployment tooling)
* **Supersedes / Amends**: N/A
* **Follow‑ups / TODOs**: Implement service mesh integration, establish monitoring and alerting baselines
