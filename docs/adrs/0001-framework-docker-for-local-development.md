* **Status**: Accepted
* **Deciders**: WebGrip Engineering Team

* **Tags**: Development::Environment, DevEx, Containerization
* **Version**: 1.0.0

## Context and Problem Statement

Development teams need a consistent, reproducible local development environment that mirrors production deployment characteristics while enabling rapid iteration and debugging. Traditional local setups suffer from "works on my machine" syndrome, dependency conflicts, and complex environment configuration that varies across developer workstations.

The template repository must provide a foundation for application development that:
- Eliminates environment drift between developers
- Supports multi-service architectures (app + databases + caching)
- Enables quick onboarding of new team members
- Provides production-like behavior in development

## Decision Drivers

| # | Driver (why this matters)                              |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | Eliminate "works on my machine" issues                 |
| 2 | Support rapid developer onboarding (< 30 minutes)     |
| 3 | Enable consistent behavior across dev/staging/prod    |
| 4 | Support multi-service development (app + DB + cache)  |
| 5 | Provide isolated environments per developer           |
| 6 | Enable debugging and hot-reload capabilities          |
| 7 | Minimize local system dependencies                    |

## Considered Options

1. **Native installation** – Direct installation of services on developer machines
2. **Virtual machines** – Full VM-based development environments (Vagrant, etc.)
3. **Docker Compose** – Containerized multi-service development stack
4. **Kubernetes development** – Local k8s clusters (minikube, kind, k3d)

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Option

**Docker Compose**

### Rationale

Docker Compose provides the optimal balance of simplicity, consistency, and production-likeness for local development. The solution offers:

- **Reproducible environments**: Identical containers across all developer machines
- **Service orchestration**: Easy coordination of application, database, and cache services
- **Volume mounting**: Enables live code reloading and debugging
- **Network isolation**: Proper service discovery and communication patterns
- **Resource efficiency**: Lighter than VMs, faster than native installations

The implementation supports PostgreSQL, Redis, and MariaDB services with proper health checks, volume persistence, and development-optimized configurations.

### Positive Consequences

* Developers can start working with `make start` in under 5 minutes
* Consistent behavior eliminates environment-related bugs
* Easy to add new services or dependencies
* Volume mounting enables real-time code changes
* Health checks ensure services are ready before dependent services start
* Proper service networking mirrors production deployment patterns
* Easy cleanup and reset capabilities

### Negative Consequences / Trade‑offs

* Requires Docker knowledge from development team
* Additional resource overhead compared to native development
* Windows developers may experience slower file system performance
* Container logs may be less intuitive than native process logs
* Debugging requires container-aware tooling

### Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk**: Docker compatibility issues on different platforms
  * **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, standardized Docker version requirements
* **Risk**: Performance degradation on older hardware
  * **Mitigation**: Resource limits configured, monitoring of developer machine specs
* **Risk**: Complex service dependencies become unwieldy
  * **Mitigation**: Clear service separation, health checks, dependency ordering

## Validation

* **Immediate proof** – Docker Compose successfully orchestrates 3+ services with health checks and proper startup ordering
* **Ongoing guardrails** – Makefile targets validate environment health, automated testing of Docker setup in CI

## Compliance, Security & Privacy Impact

Development environment containers run with minimal privileges and isolated networks. Database containers use environment-based configuration for credentials. No production data should be used in development containers. Age-encrypted secrets provide secure configuration management without exposing sensitive values in repository.

## Notes

* **Related Decisions**: ADR-002 (Kubernetes production deployment), ADR-003 (Helm deployment automation)
* **Supersedes / Amends**: N/A
* **Follow‑ups / TODOs**: Monitor developer feedback, consider dev container integration for VS Code
